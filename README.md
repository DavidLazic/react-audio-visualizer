## Demo & Examples

Example of a live app is inside _example_ directory.

Live demo: [DavidLazic.github.io/react-audio-visualizer](http://DavidLazic.github.io/react-audio-visualizer/)

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.


## Installation

The easiest way to use react-audio-visualizer is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-audio-visualizer.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-audio-visualizer --save
```


## Usage

Require Visualizer component.

```javascript
const Visualizer = require('react-audio-visualizer');

<Visualizer model={ <model> } />
```

## Development (`src`, `lib` and the build process)

**NOTE:** The source code for the component is in `src`. A transpiled CommonJS version (generated with Babel) is available in `lib` for use with node.js, browserify and webpack. A UMD bundle is also built to `dist`, which can be included without the need for any build system.

To build, watch and serve the examples (which will also watch the component source), run `npm start`. If you just want to watch changes to `src` and rebuild `lib`, run `npm run watch` (this is useful if you are working with `npm link`).


## Contributing

This project is an upgrade from my original experiment with Web Audio API written in vanilla JS. It's open for contributions, so, if you think something can be improved or you'd like a new feature, please submit a PR or we can discuss it via email also.
